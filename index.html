		<h1>Commander's Log</h1>
			There is no rest for the wicked, nor pitty for the weak.<br>
			There can be no doubt in our minds <br>
			We must find it within ourselves to lay righteousness upon our enemies. <br>
			With weapons in our hands and our gods above us, we will be victorious. <br>
	<strong>The strong must lead the weak</strong> <br><br>
